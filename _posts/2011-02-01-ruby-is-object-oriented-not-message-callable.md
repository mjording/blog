Ruby sees Objects & Blocks not messages & receivers

it may not be the fight of the century but one of the things [Fritz’ post](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/39/) reminded me of was Katz blog post last year 

[Ruby is NOT a Callable Oriented Language (It’s Object Oriented)](http://yehudakatz.com/2010/02/21/ruby-is-not-a-callable-oriented-language/)

 Hopefully Fritz will not take this as an indictment or assertion that he is unaware of proc & block behavior under the hood. Still I know I have reached for messaging composed structures as a default with Ruby and been burnt
