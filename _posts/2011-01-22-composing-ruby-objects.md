Those who know me from the NYC Ruby meetup, my consulting, or open source efforts know that I hold a candle for the Haskell Programming language. I learned the basics of Haskell around the time I was trying to make sense of some really bizarre javascript. Haskell gave me an epiphany experience in understanding Functional composition. It also came at exactly the right moment, at the beginnings of jquery and javascripts acceptance in software engineering as a grown up language.

Thanks [Douglas Crockford](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/3252).  

This is why Iâ€™m going to start my blogcasting year off by taking about Object Oriented Ruby and Composition.
