Last weekend I participated in another [hack fest](http://foodhack.wikispaces.com/ ) this time centered on the venn diagram intersection of Food and Technology. There were some great people there with great ideas that would improve the health and lifestyles of new yorkers. But I just wanted one thing that no food site has been able to deliver to me yet. Decent search results for restaurant food.. not restaurants but the actual menu items. So I sat down with some members of the new york ruby meetup and others interested in just getting this one feature and we cranked out a really simple app that gave the results in a wall of text results. 

This week a few of us spent a couple of hours on making it cleaner and its starting to shape up. Perhaps tonight you will be able to use the alpha.
