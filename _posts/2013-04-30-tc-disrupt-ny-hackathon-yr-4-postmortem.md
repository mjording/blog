This weekend the 4th New York TechCrunch Disrupt conference is happening. Every year Disrupt is proceeded by a 24 hour hack-a-thon, and as with every year before I rallied friends & colleagues to go without sleep and produce questionable code in challenging environments. 

The hack-a-thon is startup bootstraping accelerated. Finding collaborators, discovering market, communicating vision, and where I generally land, engineering a solution. 



The full reveal is going to come in a couple of posts after a full assessment of technical debt.
