MakerPath, the hack I had started at the NYC TechCrunch Disrupt Hackfest
this year, is rising from the ashes with another iteration and
potentially a first release. I'll be posting updates on what it's like
to revive a hack with spit, polish, and a dash of best practices. 


#### Intent: Personalized suggestions of best path to a learning goal. 

##### Challenges toward goal:
* Catalog of learning resources. 
* Personalized recommendation given minimal user information. 

The initial hack applied [the oasis javascript library](https://github.com/tildeio/oasis.js) similarly to [the conductor demonstration](https://github.com/tildeio/conductor.js).
